Hi this is HOAI AN, set-up Express API Server make me painful so much so I decide to create this repo.
### Usage
* `git clone https://github.com/HOAIAN2/api-sample.git`

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
> This is an API Server so you can build your owner Front-End web app and put it into `public` folder
